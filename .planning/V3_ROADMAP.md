# V3 Roadmap: Games & Virus Simulation

## Overview

V3 adds three major features to windows-xd:
1. **Classic Windows 98 Minesweeper** - Authentic recreation with timer and flag counter
2. **Windows 98 Pinball** - "Space Cadet" style pinball with physics and sounds
3. **Virus Simulation** - Cosmetic "infection" sequence for hackathon demo effect

**Target**: Hackathon demo (public)
**Safety**: All features are purely cosmetic browser-based simulations with no filesystem/OS access

  - Beginner: 9×9 grid, 10 mines
  - Intermediate: 16×16 grid, 40 mines
  - Expert: 30×16 grid, 99 mines
- First-click guarantee (never mine on first reveal)

**MINE-02**: Game Mechanics

  50%, 100% { opacity: 0.3; }
}
```

### Safety Documentation

**File to Create:**
- `.planning/VIRUS_SIMULATION_SAFETY.md` - Detailed safety documentation

**Must Include:**
- List of all effects (visual only)
- Confirmation of no FS/network access
- Code review checklist
- Disclaimer text for UI
- Instructions for disabling feature

---

## Implementation Order & Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Desktop) ✅
    │
    ├─→ Phase 7 (Minesweeper) [Independent]
    ├─→ Phase 8 (Pinball)      [Independent]
    └─→ Phase 9 (Virus)        [Independent]
```

**Recommended Order:**
1. **Phase 7** first - Simplest, good warmup, tests game integration
2. **Phase 8** second - More complex, builds on game patterns
3. **Phase 9** last - Most complex, needs careful implementation and testing

**Parallel Development:**
- All 3 phases can be developed on separate branches simultaneously
- Suggested branches: `v3-minesweeper`, `v3-pinball`, `v3-virus`
- Merge to `v3` branch for integration testing
- Final merge to `main` after hackathon-ready

---

## Testing & QA

### Per-Phase Testing

**Minesweeper:**
- Test all 3 difficulties
- Test edge cases (corner reveals, chord mistakes)
- Test timer accuracy
- Test high score persistence
- Cross-browser testing

**Pinball:**
- Test ball physics (no clipping through objects)
- Test flipper timing and responsiveness
- Test scoring accuracy
- Test audio playback
- Performance test (60 FPS maintained)

**Virus Simulation:**
- Test stage timing accuracy
- Test effects don't break underlying desktop
- Test recovery/reload works
- Test on different screen sizes
- **CRITICAL**: Security audit - verify no FS/network access

### Integration Testing

**Test Matrix:**
- Can Minesweeper run while Pinball is open?
- Does Virus simulation affect open game windows?
- Do games persist state when minimized?
- Touch controls work on mobile?

### Hackathon Demo Checklist

- [ ] All 3 features work in Chrome (primary demo browser)
- [ ] Features work in Firefox and Safari
- [ ] Mobile responsive (games scale properly)
- [ ] Audio works (with fallback for autoplay restrictions)
- [ ] Virus simulation has clear warnings
- [ ] Load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] README updated with v3 features
- [ ] Demo script prepared (show minesweeper → pinball → virus in sequence)

---

## Asset Requirements Summary

### Minesweeper
- ✅ Can use CSS/Unicode for most elements
- Optional: Custom number fonts

### Pinball
- ⚠️ Needs placeholder table background
- ⚠️ Needs placeholder sound effects
- Can use CSS for most UI elements

### Virus Simulation
- ⚠️ **Needs placeholder sprites:**
  - Butterfly (animated)
  - Purple gorilla (animated)
- ⚠️ Needs placeholder sounds
- Can use CSS for glitch effects

**Placeholder Strategy:**
- ✅ Use emoji/Unicode initially (🦋 for butterfly, 🦍 for gorilla with CSS purple filter)
- ✅ Use CSS animations for movement (float, wiggle, rotate)
- ✅ Use Web Audio API to generate sounds programmatically (beeps, white noise, tones)
- ✅ Use CSS for glitch effects (filters, transforms, overlays)
- ✅ Windows 98 UI elements created with pure CSS (borders, gradients, shadows)
- ✅ Swap with real assets before hackathon if available (optional)

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Aggressive (hackathon crunch):**
- Phase 7: 1 day
- Phase 8: 2 days
- Phase 9: 1.5 days
- Testing/polish: 0.5 days
- **Total: 5 days**

**Comfortable:**
- Phase 7: 2 days
- Phase 8: 3 days
- Phase 9: 2 days
- Testing/polish: 1 day
- **Total: 8 days**

---

## Success Metrics

**For Hackathon:**
1. ✅ All 3 features fully functional
2. ✅ No crashes or console errors during demo
3. ✅ Virus simulation "wow factor" achieved
4. ✅ Games are playable and fun
5. ✅ Demo flows smoothly (3-5 minute presentation)
6. ✅ Code is clean enough for judges to review
7. ✅ Safety documentation present and clear

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create detailed PLAN.md files** for each phase (3 files)
2. **Set up v3 branch** and phase sub-branches
3. **Create asset directories** and README for placeholders
4. **Write safety documentation** for virus simulation
5. **Begin Phase 7** (Minesweeper) implementation

**Ready to proceed?** Should I create the detailed implementation plans now?
